          <h2>Chorus</h2>
          <p>I think I like when it rains You told me to go to the light And what</p>
            <p>it's like to feel your pain Now I'm okay if you're alright I start</p>
            <p>to wonder why I came I dreamed of things you said to me We stayed at</p>
            <p>your place while it rains We talk and we laugh and watch TV</p>

          <h2>Verse 1</h2>

          <p>And I couldn't find the words I couldn't think of what to say And</p>
          <p>all that I can do is stop And think about the days When all we used</p>
          <p>to dream about Was meeting after school And we would go on home And</p>
          <p>start right back again</p>
